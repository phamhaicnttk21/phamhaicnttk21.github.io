Overview
======
- I’m a recent Software Engineering graduate from Hanoi University with a solid academic background and practical experience in backend and web development. I’ve worked with Java and Spring Boot to build secure APIs and gained exposure to deploying microservices using Docker and Kubernetes.
- I’m familiar with _Agile_ and _Scrum_ workflows and have had the opportunity to apply microservice architecture concepts in real project settings. Along the way, I’ve also learned how to design databases, use version control with _Git_, write unit tests with _JUnit_, and manage database changes using _Liquibase_.
- I’m now looking for a _Junior Backend Developer_**** role where I can contribute to meaningful projects, learn from experienced teammates, and continue developing my skills in a supportive and dynamic environment. I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and excited to grow as a developer in a real-world setting.
